## History

The inspiration for the project came from Reuben's experience using the Jepson Manual to identify plants. While the information in the Jepson Manual is second to none, Reuben often found himself losing his place in the key, or encountering an unfamiliar word, which required additional resources. The goal of this project is to improve the user experience of the Jepson Manual, while maintaining the remarkable quality of the resource.
